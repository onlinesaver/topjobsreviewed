<h1>Affiliate Disclaimer</h1>
<p>Hi. Sarah Johnson here. I&rsquo;ve always believed in transparency on the web and so I am disclosing that I&rsquo;ve included certain products and links to those products on this site that I will earn an affiliate commission for any purchases you make. My goal with the blog is to help educate you on the possibilities that exist for making money online, but please understand I am doing this as a for-profit business and, frankly, so should you with your site unless you have some charitable endeavor in mind.</p>
<p>The site has grown so big at this point that it is nearly impossible to go back through and list each and every program that I have an affiliate agreement with. Given this, you should assume that any links leading you to products or services are affiliate links that I will receive compensation from just to be safe. I only promote those products or services that I have investigated and truly feel deliver value to you.</p>
<p>Please note that I have not been given any free products, services or anything else by these companies in exchange for mentioning them on the site. The only consideration is in the form of affiliate commissions or compensation as an advisor for a few companies.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to contact me by using the contact page. It can be accessed on the menu above.</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck!</p>
<p>Sarah Johnson</p>
