			<strong>Review...</strong>
		</p>
		<p class="style67">
			 I was actually very curious about reviewing this program because I had recently seen it on TV and the radio (and especially considering I had just finished two straight months of testing what turned out to be one scam after another). So I wondered, was it more of the same or would it actually live up to it's word? I really wanted to find out for myself, but I was still skeptical.
		</p>
		<p class="style67">
			Well to begin, Computer Strength 			 was very easy to sign up with.&nbsp; After I got my starter package, I jumped right in that day and watched all of&nbsp; the detailed tutorials. The work is easy and straight forward using the impressive software and free coaching they provide. In short, they have discovered a unique way of making money that get's you paid by Fortune 500 companies without selling, buying, or shipping products. If you can send email, you can use this program to make money from home. This allows ordinary people to work with solid companies that are profiting in the current economy. And it turns out that this system not only works, it works great. You just have to post links online which they will give clear instructions how-to.
		</p>
		<p class="style67">
			After following the instructions I made my first $100 the next day. I then received my first check within the week. In fact, we ended up liking Computer Strength 			 because it was by far the most lucrative over time. We were able to start making about $150 a day very quickly. This may not sound like a lot but, it did increase week after week.
		</p>
		<p class="style67" align="left">
			It's definitely programs like this that make doing research so enjoyable for me. It's win win for everyone, and certainly for me because I finally found something I will be making money with for a long time (Just please don't get me started on the months I wasted on scams!).
		</p>
		<p class="style67" align="left">
			We think this will be the best investment you ever make if you want to make money from home. But please don't take our word for it, the member reviews speak for themselves.
		</p>
		<p class="style68" align="left">
			Conclusion: With an easy to use system and high average earnings, this program skyrocketed to the top of our list. If you would like to learn more, we highly recommend checking availability ASAP to avoid disappointment. We give them 5 Stars.

			Review...
		</p>
		<p class="style67" align="left">
			Online Foundation is very easy to join. We got access to all of our online membership resources and had our first assignments immediately. After completing some surveys and evaluations we submitted our results and within a few days we had our first check.
		</p>
		<p class="style67" align="left">
			We recommend Online Foundation because it offered great support while allowing us to choose from a variety of assignments including posting ads, evaluations, and more. They give you all the resources you need to get started, from the ad posting links to the email templates you'll use to complete the work and submit for payment.
		</p>
		<p class="style67" align="left">
			This program also has direct customer support from their professional staff to make sure you get started making money as soon as possible. This additional help is rare, and a valuable resource you can use to help you make a living from home by doing this kind of work.
		</p>
		<p class="style67" align="left">
			Now, they say you will make $4500+ a month but based on our experience it was more like $3300 a month possible for one person working part time from home.
		</p>
		<p class="style67" align="left">
			The cost for this program is pretty reasonable. They currently have a 75<em>% off</em> promotion that makes getting started less expensive.
		</p>
		<p class="style68" align="left">
			With the great support and the variety of assignments this was a great program in our opinion and a clear top pick this year. We give them 4.5 Stars out of Five. A very respectable showing. </span>

		<p class="style67">
			<span class="style46"><strong>The Pros:</strong></span>
			Dependable steady income; No experience required; make money within 15 minutes; clear instructions; simple ready to go system that anyone can follow;
		</p>
		<p class="style67">
			<strong class="style46">The Cons:</strong> Successful applicants to the program have to check early and often for positions to open (we would actually recommend checking right now); internet connection required; ability to use e-mail required
		</p>
		<p class="style67">
			<strong class="style46">Conclusion:</strong> The Computer Improvement  does the second best job we've ever seen of making people money immediately. It's also probably the absolute easiest system out thre as well. It delivers quick income unbelievably easy. It definitely lives up to it's promises and that's why it's one of the best.
		</p>
		<p class="style46">
			 Review...
		</p>
		<p class="style67">
			Simply put, Computer Improvement  allows you to earn over $37/hour working at home with only simple skills required (if you can't use something like e-mail...then this might be too hard for you). This revolutionary program is without a doubt one of the best ways of making money online. Computer Improvement  offers one of the fastest ways to make money online as they have designed the program to replace a full time income with as little as 2 hours of work per day. On average, members of Computer Improvement  are making around $219 per day, however some of the top earners are making over $400 in the same time-frame.
		</p>
		<p class="style67">
			The program sets you up with your own website (don't worry, they do ALL the work for you), and you simply begin posting links with large companies like Facebook, Yahoo and Bing for name brand companies. They pay you directly through check or direct deposit within the week. Anyone who wants to make money online but has failed before should use Computer Improvement  , as we believe it will be the last job you ever need.
		</p>
		<p class="style67">
			We were impressed with the amount of money that you can make with this system. And we were even more impressed with how "dummy-proof" they made it. The big problem we normally have with other programs is that they are too confusing with too many options, and you never really know if your doing it the right way. Computer Improvement  is the solution that makes those frustrations a thing of the past. It is very clear that quite a bit of time and effort by really smart people went into making this the program it is today.
		</p>
		<p class="style67">
			We must warn you that positions are very limited and only a few positions were made available per city. In practice, this has allowed members to make much more money than most other programs out there.
		</p>
		<p class="style67">
			<span class="style68">With the ability to work with large companies and easy consistent earnings, this is a very attractive program in our opinion. We gave them a well deserved 4.0 Stars. Positions are filling up fast, so if you would like to get started, just click below. </span>

			<span class="style67 style79">(Editor's Tip: On average, readers who chose to use at least two of these top programs are making over $8,000 a month. If you are serious about working from home and need money quickly, this may be an exciting option for you to try)</span>

				@Thomas, I'm using it now and it's working pretty well actually! I've signed up for an account and have been cranking along ever since. My first week I made a whopping $288 and the second week I doubled that then it kinda snowballed to $500 a day! I'm gonna grow this puppy as big as I can. <br>

				Is this for real? I tried one thing and it didn't pan out. I made about $500 a month but that was 2 years ago. I'm going to give this a shot.

				Hey Dan, the answer is No. Any computer you have will work, I currently use this system on an old laptop and it works great. You just need the kit that the author named in the article.

				I'd just like to add my story; I think others would like to hear it. I too was always leery about work at home offers because they always seemed to be scams. I was a little frightened, but I wanted to have a backup plan just in case. So, I took your advice and got my  kit. It worked like a charm - I was earning money right away! I eventually did get laid off, just as I had feared, but since I had been using the kit, I had money to fall back on. Now I'm doing better than I had at my job!
